1. What is a view engine?

In an ASP.NET Core MVC application, a component called the view engine is used to 
produce the content sent to clients. The default view engine is called Razor, and 
it processes annotated HTML files for instructions that insert dynamic content into
the output sent to the browser.

2. What is Razor?

Razor is the view engine responsible for incorporating data into HTML documents.

3. What do views do? List two specific things in your answer to this question.

The ability to dynamically generate content is essential to being able to write
a web application. Razor provides features that make it easy to work with the
rest of the ASP.NET Core MVC using C# statements.

4. How does Razor respond when it encounters statements that begin with the at
character (@)? Be specific.

The @ character starts inline expressions, single statement blocks, and multi-statement blocks:
You add code to a page using the @ character.

5. How does Razor respond when it encounters statements that begin with the at 
character followed by the colon (@:)? Be specific.
6. Describe how you implement a standard formatting for all pages in an ASP.NET application.
7. What is the difference in using Razor to interpolate data values as stand-alone HTML 
elements and as attributes to HTML elements. What is the similarity?
8. What is a view start file and where is it located?
9. What is a Razor code block? What is the syntax of a Razor code block?

ASP.NET Razor Code Blocks. Code block is used to enclose C# code statements. It starts with
 @ (at) character and is enclosed by {} (curly braces). Unlike expressions, C# code inside code
 blocks is not rendered. ... HTML within a code block will be rendered as HTML.
 
10. Describe the different roles of action methods and views.
11. Describe the use of the @using statement. Give an example of how you would use it.

The objects specified within the using block must implement the IDisposable interface. 
The framework invokes the Dispose method of objects specified within the "using" 
statement when the block is exited.
using (var font1 = new Font("Arial", 10.0f)) 
{
    byte charset = font1.GdiCharSet;
}
