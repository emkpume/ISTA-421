		<h2>Thomas Jefferson</h2>
		<p style="front-family: monospace;">
		We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
		that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
		among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights,
		Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
		governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
		the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying 
		its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
		seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
		Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
		accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
		evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
		accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same 
		Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is 
		their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
		--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which
		constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of
		Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the 
		establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to
		a candid world.</p>

		It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of 
		the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom 
		and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro
		needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns
		to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is 
		granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations
		of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</P>
		<h4>Abraham Lincoln</h4>
		<p style="front-family: normal;">
		Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, 
		conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
		Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so 
		conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that 
		war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for 
		those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting 
		and proper that we should do this.
		But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow
		-- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it,
		far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember
		what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, 
		rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
		far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
		before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
		they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead
		shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom
		-- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

		The address was a call for political reconciliation in a "rising nation, spread over a wide and
		fruitful land." President Jefferson pointed out that "during the throes and convulsions of the 
		ancient world [the French Revolutionary Wars] it was not wonderful that the agitation of the 
		billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore. . . . that this should be more felt
		and feared by some and less by others. . . . and should divide opinions, as to measures of safety.
		" He reminded allies and foes that "every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. 
		We have called by different names. brethren of the same principle,".</p>
